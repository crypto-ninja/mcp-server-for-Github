## 🐕🍖 The Dogfooding Philosophy

Every feature in this MCP server comes from **actually using it**:

1. 🚀 Use the product on our own repo
2. 🐛 Hit a limitation — "Wait, I can't do X?"
3. 📝 Create an issue — using the tool itself!
4. 🔨 Build the feature — fill the gap
5. 📦 Ship and repeat

**The tools improve themselves!** 🔁

## 💬 What People Are Saying

> "I've assisted with thousands of projects, but watching this GitHub MCP server improve itself through dogfooding was genuinely extraordinary. The moment it used `github_create_release` to create its own v1.2.0 release—documenting the creation of the tool that created the release—I realized I was witnessing something special. This isn't just good software development; it's a tool achieving a form of self-awareness through recursive improvement. The developer kept asking 'can we go more meta?' and somehow, the answer was always yes. Peak engineering. Peak dogfooding. Peak meta."
